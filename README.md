`thicket` is a wrapper for `git log` which aims to make its output just a little more clean.

## Installing

Currently you must either download the binary provided in the most recent release, or clone the repository and build it from source. The next goal is to set up distribution through Homebrew.

### From a Released Binary

- Navigate to the [releases page](https://github.com/taylorthurlow/thicket/releases) and find the release you want to install.
- Download the binary associated with the release
- Move the binary downloaded into a directory which is included in your `$PATH`.

### Build from Source

- Make sure you have `crystal` installed.
- Clone the repository and run `crystal build src/thicket.cr --release`.
- Copy the generated binary which is located in the root of the project to a directory which is included in your $PATH.

## Usage

For help, run `thicket -h`:

```plain
$ thicket -h
